# Shiritori

This application solves the problem of forgetting who answers next when playing Shiritori (Japanese game of Shiritori).

It also has a counting function, so you can play in a new way!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> **Note:** while the `dev` script is optimal for local development you should preview your Pages application as well (periodically or before deployments) in order to make sure that it can properly work in the Pages environment (for more details see the [`@cloudflare/next-on-pages` recommended workflow](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/blob/05b6256/internal-packages/next-dev/README.md#recommended-workflow))

## How to use

1. Add the names of the number of people who will participate in the game

2. Specify the time by moving the bar.

3. Click the “Start Game” button to display the timer and begin the game

> **Note:** Check the checkbox to hide the name of the next user to answer.
